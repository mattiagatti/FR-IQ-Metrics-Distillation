# Configuration for training on degraded ImageNet dataset


# Degradation: gaussian_noise, additive_color_noise, spatially_correlated_noise, masked_noise, high_freq_noise, impulse_noise, quantization_noise, gaussian_blur, brightness_shift, contrast_change, saturation_change, pixelation, color_quantization
# 200 reference images from ImageNet (13 degradations type x 5 levels = 13 000 images) used for training, validation and test.
