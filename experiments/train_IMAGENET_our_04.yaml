# Configuration for training on degraded ImageNet dataset


# Degradation: Gaussian_blur, motion_blur, jpeg_compression, brightness, contrast, saturation, additive_noise, chromatic_aberration, pixelation, color_cast
# Random selection of number of degradations applied per image during training, level randomly selected.
